# So, you made a mix?

This web app was planned to be a tool to help DJ's who drafted a mix in Spotify to deep dive into more info like the song's BPM, key, LUFS and song structure, and then use that info to rearrange the tracks and then be saved back to Spotify. Then, with 1 button click, the user would be able to add all the tracks in the playlist to their cart in Beatport.

This relied on 2 APIs.

  1. Spotify API (particularly Track Audio Feature / Anaylsis endpoint); and
  2. Beatport API

Access to both has been nuked. Beatport just stopped handing out keys, and Spotify deprecated their API after it was being abused to train AI models (this is why we can't have nice things...)

I doubt these features will open back up again in the near future, so this project is dead in the water.
